# HBCUnite Presented By the NFL

This project was development initially started by the Philander Smith College Team for the HBCU BOTB competition

## Solution Overview
HBCUnite is a next-gen web platform for the HBCU community.  The goal is to go beyond a website and create an immersive platform that serves as “a one-stop shop” for various NFL initiatives and programs geared towards helping HBCU students.  A platform will give us the engagement aspect we seek due to its interactive nature. We envision this platform to be gamified in an attempt to increase user retention and engagement. Consequently, this will allow the NFL to efficiently communicate information and personalized opportunities with each user. 

## Solution Features
- A redefined virtual and gamified web experience for users
- A simplified program application experience for users
- A personal data hub that keep tracks of users’ stats and measures progress
- A clear and data-driven road map that shows the path from a HBCU student to an NFL professional.
- Utilizing technology to drive the mission of the current NFL and HBCU partnerships, the platform will allow:
- Virtual viewing of the bowl game
- A virtual museum celebrating HBCU NFL players as player cards

## Tech Stack

After designing, we set out to implement componenents and pages for our solution. Our vision for the tech stack was MERN (MongoDB Express React Node). We started using api such as react-three-fiber and three.js for 3d rendering and VR on the web. 

## Next steps
The next steps include to continue working on the development of the project, using the Design file as a visual guide.
